Do your mother or grandmother still have their old handwritten Recipe Book? In some families, it is a tradition to pass down this book containing cherished, traditional recipes to the next generation. However, in today's digital age, the majority of people prefer using their digital devices over handwritten books.

With our app, you can seamlessly digitize the timeless recipes from your family's collection. Additionally, you have the flexibility to incorporate your own creations or favorite recipes from the internet, friends, and more, all within your personal Digital Recipe Book. Each recipe can be enhanced with a suitable image, and thanks to the app's database connection, all your recipes are securely stored for future generations!

## Features

🧁 Each recipe has its own detailed page, displaying all stored information
🧁 Manage your recipes by updating or deleting them as needed.
🧁 Navigate through an organized overview page that displays all added recipes in alphabetical order.

This app was developed by Gabriele, Gökhan, and Stephan as a capstone project during our web developer bootcamp at neue fische in 2023. 
We all began as complete novices with no practical coding experience. We are very proud of what we archieved.

While our app is not in its final state, we have numerous ideas to implement, and we eagerly anticipate continuing our learning journey, 
practicing more, and further developing our app. We are excited about the future possibilities and growth of our project!
